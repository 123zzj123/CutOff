/// Interface for triangulators.
/// The outlines to be triangulated should be specified in the
/// constructor of an implementing class and should include:
	/// A list of points in space. 1 point occupies 1 array element.
	/// A list of edges, integer indices referencing 2 points per edge. 1 edge occupies 2 subsequent array elements.

	/// The new edges needed to correctly triangulate the outlines.
	/// Specified in the same format as the input edges.
	/// The newEdges should be appended to the input edges for the

	/// <param name="newTriangles">
	/// The new triangles.
	/// A triangle occupies 3 array elements, each of which corresponds to
	/// a point index.
	/// Triangles have clockwise winding order.
	/// For example, newTriangles[11 * 3 + 2] equals the 12th triangle's 3rd point.

	/// The corresponding edges of the new triangles.
	/// A triangle occupies 3 array elements, each of which corresponds to
	/// an edge index.
	/// References the edges by their index, not the where they lie in the array.
	/// For example, edges[newTriangleEdges[5 * 3 + 1] * 2 + 0] equals the
	/// 1th point of the 6th triangle's 2nd edge.
