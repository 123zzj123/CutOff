The HierarchyHandler helper script makes it possible to use the ShatterTool script within game object hierarchies. Attach a ShatterTool script and a HierarchyHandler script to all game objects in the hierarchy that will be shattered, or are parents to/children of game objects that will be shattered. Make sure that PreSplitMsg and PostSplitMsg are enabled on the ShatterTool scripts.

Whenever a game object in the hierarchy is shattered, the HierarchyHandler will detach and reattach the other game objects in the hierarchy to account for the newly created pieces.

See the Hierarchy scene for an example.


The following settings can be tweaked on the HierarchyHandler on a game object basis:

Attach Piece To Parent - If enabled, will attach the piece closest to the parent as a child to the parent

Max Piece To Parent Distance - A cut-off value that determines when not to connect a piece to the parent

Add Rb To Detached Pieces - If enabled, will add a Rigidbody component to all pieces that are no longer part of the hierarchy


Attach Children To Pieces - If enabled, will attach each child of this game object to the piece that is closest

Max Child To Piece Distance - A cut-off value that determines when not to connect a child to a piece

Add Rb To Detached Children - If enabled, will add a Rigidbody component to all children that are no longer part of the hierarchy
